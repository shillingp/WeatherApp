# Preact/React Weather App


## Installation
**1. Clone this repo:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shillingp/WeatherApp.git my-app
cd my-app
```


**2. Make it your own:**

```sh
rm -rf .git && git init && npm init
```

> This re-initializes the repo and sets up your NPM project.


**3. Install the dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

> You're done installing! Now let's get started developing.


## Development Workflow
**4. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.

**5. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```

**5. Start local production server with [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve):**

```sh
npm start
```

> This is to simulate a production (CDN) server with gzip. It just serves up the contents of `./build`.
